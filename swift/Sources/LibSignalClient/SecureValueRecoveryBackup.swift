// MARK: - SvrB Service

/// Service for Secure Value Recovery for Backups (SVR-B) operations.
///
/// This service provides forward secrecy for Signal backups using SVR-B. Forward secrecy ensures
/// that even if the user's Account Entropy Pool or Backup Key is compromised, the attacker can
/// decrypt only a very small number of past backups. This is achieved by storing a token
/// in a secure enclave inside the SVR-B server, which provably attests that it
/// only stores a single token at a time for each user.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// To achieve these properties, a secret token is required to derive the actual encryption
/// keys for the backup. At backup time, this token must be stored in the SVR-B server, overwriting the
/// previous token. At restore time, the token must be retrieved from the SVR-B server, and used to
/// derive the encryption keys for the backup.
///
/// ## Storage Flow
///
/// 1. Create a ``Net`` instance and get the `SvrB` service via ``Net/svrB(auth:)``
/// 2. If this is a fresh install, call ``createNewBackupChain(backupKey:)`` and store the result locally.
///    Otherwise, retrieve the secret data from the last **successful** backup operation (store or restore).
/// 3. Call ``store(backupKey:previousSecretData:)``, passing the data from step (2).
/// 4. Use the returned forward secrecy token to derive encryption keys
/// 5. Encrypt and upload the backup data to the user's remote, off-device storage location, including the
///    returned ``StoreBackupResponse/metadata``. The upload **must succeed**
///    before proceeding or the previous backup might become unretrievable.
/// 5. Store the returned ``StoreBackupResponse/nextBackupSecretData`` locally, overwriting any previously-saved value.
///
/// ## Secret handling
///
/// When calling ``store(backupKey:previousSecretData:)``, the `previousSecretData` parameter must
/// be from the last call to  `store` or `restore` that succeeded. This "chaining" is used to
/// construct each backup file so that it can be decrypted with either the *previous* token stored
/// in SVR-B, or the *next* one, which is important in case the overall backup upload is ever
/// interrupted.
///
/// The returned secret from a successful store or restore should be persisted until it is
/// overwritten by the value from a subsequent successful call. The caller should use
/// ``createNewBackupChain(backupKey:)`` only for the very first backup with a particular backup
/// key.
///
/// ## Restore Flow
///
/// 1. Create a ``Net`` instance and get the ``SvrB`` service via ``Net/svrB(auth:)``
/// 2. Fetch the backup metadata from storage
/// 3. Call ``restore(backupKey:metadata:)`` to get the forward secrecy token
/// 4. Use the token to derive decryption keys
/// 5. Decrypt and restore the backup data
/// 6. Store the returned ``RestoreBackupResponse/nextBackupSecretData`` locally.
///
/// ## Usage
/// ```swift
/// let net = Net(env: .production, userAgent: "MyApp")
/// let auth = Auth(username: "username", password: "password")
/// let svrB = net.svrB(auth: auth)
///
/// // Prepare a backup
/// let response = try svrB.storeBackup(backupKey: myKey, previousSecretData: previousSecretData)
/// // ... store backup with response.forwardSecrecyToken ...
/// // Securely store response.nextBackupSecretData for the next backup
/// ```
///
